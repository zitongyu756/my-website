            <div id="item1" class="grid-item full-width">
                <p>My name is Zitong Yu. I'm currently a sophomore at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>. My major is
                    Computer Science joint Math and I'm a student developer. My academic journey at NYU has been focused on honing my skills in JAVA,
                    complemented by studies in data structures and machine learning. I am also looking forward to enhancing my knowledge in basic
                    algorithms and computer system organization in the upcoming semester.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to my diverse technical background, I have a strong interest in front-end development, a field
                    where creativity meets functionality. My studies in web design at NYU have equipped me with a solid
                    understanding of essential front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've had the
                    opportunity to delve into more advanced aspects of professional web development, including media queries for
                    responsive design and DOM manipulation for dynamic web content. This website is one of my projects that I
                    developed from scratch. This project was not only a practical application of my technical abilities but also a creative outlet, allowing me to bring my ideas to life in a
                    visually appealing and user-friendly format. It stands as a testament to my capability to blend aesthetic
                    design with functional programming in creating compelling digital experiences. </p>

                <p>
                    As a college student exploring this tech field, I've been part of several projects that have been
                    crucial to my learning and growth. Each of them is important in shaping my abilities. I've put together a collection of
                    these projects, which really show how far I've come since I started.
